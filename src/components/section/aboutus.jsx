              All the students who join Universal International School, should
              find a happy environment where they are encouraged to nurture a
              lifelong love for knowledge and all wholesome activities that help
              develop body, mind and soul. When they are ready to move on from
              here they should take their knowledge and everything they have
              learned here, improve upon it and pass it on to those younger than
              themselves. This makes U.I.S. , the tree that branches out and
              gives life , love , protection , knowledge and discipline to so
              many others in the world's society.

              Universal International School is proud to be a multi religious,
              multi cultural and multi ethnic institute that builds within
              youngsters a foundation for success through a formation program,
              which is rooted in the students' own inherited beliefs and we
              emphasize faith, leadership, academics, and service. We aspire,
              through the grace of the Almighty, to be recognized as the best
